        <question>What is the difference between a How-To and a
        tutorial?</question>
        <answer>
          <p>
            The goal of a How-To is to help the reader to accomplish a specific
            task with clear and consise instructions. While tutorials may
            contain How-To-like instructions and content, they also include
            additional background and conceptual content to help teach their
            readers higher order concepts along the way. How-Tos are concerned
            about filling an immediate, short-term need. Tutorials often provide
            long-term knowledge which can be applied across a range of needs.
